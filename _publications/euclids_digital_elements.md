Abstract: In this workshop we propose an activity to explore a geometric drawing software as an easy and quick tool to plan and perform bold and beautiful geometric paterns based on simple well-known constructions with straightedge and compass. The workshop might be of particular interest either to teachers trying to rise interest in Geometry through artistic activities or to both experienced and experiencing mathematical artists involved in plane geometrical drawings. No previous knowledge on the software used, Geogebra, will be required, but the participants are expected to be able to have access to the software, or an equivalent one, during the workshop.
