Abstract: In this paper we present the development of two websites — “Derivando a Matemática” and “Curvas, Superfícies e Arquitetura” — one developed with the goal of creating a source of learning materials for students and teachers of Mathematics and the other to discussing which geometrical curves and surfaces occur in architectural structures — and how they started to collaborate, amplifying the reach of their content.
