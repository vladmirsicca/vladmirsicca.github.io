Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a metric in a given conformal class with prescribed nonpositive scalar curvature and nonpositive boundary mean curvature on a compact manifold with boundary, and establish a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of a conformal invariant that measures the zero set of the target curvatures.
