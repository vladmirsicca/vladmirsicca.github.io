I am a Brazilian mathematician currently working as an ATER (temporary teaching and research position in France) at Université Paris-Panthéon-Assas in Paris. My research has touched applied and theoretical topics in Mathematics and Physics, including applications of mathematics to optics, general relativity, architecture, mathematical education, artificial intelligence and automatic solvers. I also have experience and passion in teaching mathematics at university level.

Since 2024 I have worked in the team that developed Newclid, a geometric solver built on top of the deterministic solver behind Google DeepMind's AlphaGeometry, first at the Huawei Lagrange Center, then in collaboration with Harmonic. Our work with Harmonic was part of the [gold medal performance of their AI agent Aristotle in the IMO 2025](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1BdGYqEkOYyGX). The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Newclid/Newclid).
