I am a Brazilian mathematician currently working as a researcher at Huawei's Lagrange Center in Paris. My research has touched applied and theoretical topics in Mathematics and Physics, including optics, general relativity, architecture, mathematical education, and automatic solvers. The connecting line of my research and mathematical. I also have experience and passion in teaching mathematics at a university level.

My last finished project was on the development of Newclid, a geometric solver built on top of the deterministic solver behind Google DeepMind's AlphaGeometry, at the Huawei Lagrange Center. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/LMCRC/Newclid).
